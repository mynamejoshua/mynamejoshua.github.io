          <li>React</li>

      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> Animations, React useState Propagaiton</p>        
      <p><b>Solution+Expirence:</b> Prior to this project, I had never thought about SVG graphics. I followed a handful of tutorials and was able to create a simple demo of the stickman forming. After this I focused on creating the game logic for hangman, initally with an input box and a submit button. Once I was sure that I had a simple solution o the game logic, I began to improve the UI, and created the keypad. I made sure to reuse the same component of the display squares. However, If this project were to scale larger I would like to seperate responsibility more. I made an effort to emphasize the compatibility with a future backend.</p>
      <p><b>My Contributions: </b>All of the code seen in the linked repo is my own. This project was taken further, where other members on my team fleshed out the backend, and I was able to make simple changes to tie everything together on the frontend.</p>

      <p><b>Technical Challenge:</b> Backend Routes, Session Preservation, JSON communication</p>        
      <p><b>Solution+Expirence:</b> This project built apon a past register + authorization codebase. The main areas of exploration were with the backend, and overall communication. I learned many lessons on how to properly construct a backend API, and how to use cookies to enhance the websites behavior. In the end, There was not too much code, but the journey was long. This project taught me alot about backend communication, and how even simple addition and subtraction can become an involved chore if done incorrectly.</p>
      <p><b>My Contributions: </b>I worked on every part of this project, however my main contributions were to the bank.js routes. I took care to ensure that no unauthorized user could call the routes.</p>
